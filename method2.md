# Introduction

Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a method both for data collection and for statistical inference. The unit of analysis in RDS is a network structure rather than an individual, and the analysis generalizes to the networks of the sampled population. Unlike traditional sampling methods, this method of analysis influences the kind of estimators we use, the way we understand the variance around the estimates, and how we interpret the findings.

# Background

Across the U.S., Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-designated Continuum of Care (CoC) agencies are mandated to conduct a count of people experiencing homelessness at least every other year. As the CoC for King County fulfills its obligation under Section 578.7 of the CoC Program interim rule, it must plan and conduct a Point-in-Time (PIT) Count—a count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons carried out on one night in the last 10 calendar days of January or at such other time as required by HUD.

# Survey Design

## Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS)

Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) combines "snowball sampling" with a mathematical model that weighs the sample to compensate for the fact that the sample was collected in a non-random way. It employs multiple waves of peer-to-peer recruitment to approximate random sampling within “hard-to-reach” socially networked populations.

## RDS Assumptions

## RDS Estimation

### RDS Estimator

Current estimators for RDS analysis are primarily developed to describe proportions in a network and make inference about an entire network based on information about the known part of the network (the part in your sample).

### RDS-II Estimator (Volz & Heckathorn, 2008)

## Data Requirements for RDS Analysis

- **Personal Network Size (Degree):** The number of people the respondent knows within the target population.
- **Respondent's Serial Number:** The serial number of the coupon used to recruit the respondent.
- **Respondent's Recruiting Serial Numbers:** Serial numbers from the coupons given to the respondent for further recruitment.

# Data Collection Process

## IRB and Ethical Considerations

Before initiating the research, the research team secured approval from the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (IRB) for this study involving human subjects. 

## Seed Selection

Seed selection is a critical step in Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) as it initiates the recruitment chain. For the 2023 UW King County Understanding Homelessness Project, the seed selection process was designed to ensure diversity and representation within the target population of individuals experiencing homelessness. 

### Criteria for Seed Selection

1. **Demographic Representation:** Seeds were chosen to represent a range of demographic characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity, and homelessness status (e.g., sheltered vs. unsheltered).
2. **Network Size:** Seeds were selected based on their personal network size within the target population. This ensured that they had sufficient connections to effectively initiate recruitment.
3. **Community Involvement:** Individuals with established connections to local community organizations or networks were prioritized to enhance the reach and effectiveness of the recruitment process.

### Recruitment of Seeds

Seeds were recruited through a combination of outreach efforts, including collaborations with local service providers, shelters, and community organizations. Potential seeds were approached with detailed information about the study and were selected based on their willingness to participate and their ability to recruit others.

## Consent and Participation

Ensuring informed consent and maintaining participant confidentiality were paramount throughout the study.

### Informed Consent

1. **Consent Form:** Participants were provided with a consent form that detailed the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits. The form also outlined how their data would be used and assured them of confidentiality.
2. **Voluntary Participation:** Participants were informed that their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time without any negative consequences.

### Confidentiality

1. **Data Protection:** Personal identifiers were removed from the dataset to maintain confidentiality. Unique identifiers were used to track responses while ensuring that individual identities were protected.
2. **Secure Storage:** All data were stored in encrypted files and secured servers to prevent unauthorized access.

## Survey Administration

- **Survey Administration:**
  - Volunteers administered the survey using Qualtrics.
  - Assistance was provided for participants with disabilities or language barriers.
  - Proactive steps were taken to ensure accessibility, including guiding participants to suitable locations.
  - Participants received verbal confirmation of successful submission and a thank-you message.

- **Incentives:**
  - $20.00 gift card for completing the survey.
  - Three QR coupon sheets for referrals.
  - Additional $10 for participating in the PSD survey.
  - $5 virtual gift card for each referral up to a maximum of $15.
  - Two bus tickets for participants in hard-to-access locations.


## Survey Duration and Locations

- **Duration:**
  - Data collection: Late April to early June (just over a month).

- **Locations:**
  - Seven site locations:
    - Ballard Public Library
    - Burien Public Library
    - Bellevue Library
    - Central Library
    - South Lucile Street VA Clinic (non-Seattle Public Library site)
    - Federal Way Public Library
    - South Park Library
    - Lake City Library

- **Operation Hours:**
  - Typical hours: 10 AM to 5-6 PM.
  - Extended hours for site managers for equipment retrieval.

- **Survey Schedule:**
  - Data collection days: Monday through Saturday.
  - Typical shift structure:
    - Morning shift: 10 AM to 2 PM.
    - Evening shift: 2 PM to 6 PM.
  - Total surveying hours per site per day: 8 hours.
  - Each site typically had 5-7 volunteers and one site manager per shift.


# Data Processing and Analysis

## Data Cleaning



## Data Weighting and Adjustment

To ensure that the results were representative of the target population, data weighting and adjustment were applied.

1. **Weight Calculation:** Weights were calculated based on the number of recruits each participant was responsible for and the network size of the participants. This adjusted for any biases introduced by the non-random sampling process.
2. **Adjustments for Demographic Representation:** Adjustments were made to account for discrepancies between the sample and the target population's demographic distribution.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed to derive insights and draw conclusions from the data.

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Basic descriptive statistics, such as means, medians, and proportions, were calculated to summarize the data and provide an overview of the sample characteristics.
2. **Inferential Statistics:** Advanced statistical techniques, including regression analysis and hypothesis testing, were used to make inferences about the larger population based on the sample data.
3. **RDS Analysis:** Specialized RDS estimators, such as the RDS-II estimator, were employed to analyze the network data and adjust for the sampling design.


# Conclusion

This methods section outlines the critical components of the data collection, processing, and analysis methodologies employed in the 2023 UW King County Understanding Homelessness Project. The use of Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) provides a robust framework for studying hard-to-reach populations, ensuring that the insights drawn from this research are both valid and reliable.
